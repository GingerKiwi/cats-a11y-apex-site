# Crazy Cats Coffee Web Accessibility Project

Crazy Cats Coffee Web Accessibility Project facilitates developers learning and incorporating web accessibility (A11y) best practices into their daily workflow. The core of the project is a set of articles with clearly outlined accessibility concepts. Each article is accompanied by an example code block and an example from the fictitious "Crazy Cats Coffee Shop".

The project started as a single article with a codepen in 2023. It's now grown to a series of articles and tech talks with a set of example codebases and websites for the fictional "Crazy Cats Coffee Shop". As of April 2024, the vanilla example site is deployed. The links for that are on this website.
